    "Welcome to FrontierSI’s Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Sandbox. Here you can access an instance of the Open Data Cube (ODC) that has data indexed and ready to go. This sandbox utilises data products that Geoscience Australia have made available on their DEA public S3 storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to Python, this sandbox will introduce you to a series of protoype apps that can be used to explore available Australian data. These come in the form of simple graphical user interfaces that will allow you to visualise various data products.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are more familiar with Python, the sandbox provides a way to explore how the ODC API interacts with DEA products, demonstrating the power of accessing earth observation data on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ODC\n",
    "\n",
    "The apps we'll use in this notebook have been built ontop of the ODC. The ODC is an open source library that provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment. It is capable of delivering decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite data, as well as related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODC manual can be found at http://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To use the notebook ->  Click your mouse onto the cell below, and push ctrl+enter, or click the run button from the toolbox above."

    "* Use the rectangle draw tool on the left of the map to outline of your area of interest\n",
    "* Select a date range for satellite data using the blue slider\n",
    "* Before you press the 'Query Cube' button, move to the next cell -- this will check the size of your selected case-study area. It will return a message to let you know if the area you've selected is a good size\n",
